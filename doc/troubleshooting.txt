Troubleshooting
===============
This document deals with system issues which prevent RackMonkey running or
using its database.

RackMonkey Won't Run
--------------------
If you get an 'Internal Server Error' or the web server displays the text of
rackmonkey.pl (rather than executing it), check your web server error log.

Common reasons for RackMonkey failing to run are:

* The #! line at the top of rackmonkey.pl can't find env in /usr/bin
  This is the usual cause of errors of the form: 
      [error] (2)No such file or directory: exec of rackmonkey.pl failed
  You can fix this by editing the #! line to point at env or directly at perl.

* Permissions incorrect set for rackmonkey.pl. Usually solved by running:
      $ chmod 755 rackmonkey.pl

* ExecCGI isn't turned on for the directory in which rackmonkey.pl resides or
  for files of type .pl (this problem applies to Apache web servers).
  Edit your Apache configuration to allow CGIs to be run. For more help on
  using Apache see: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/
        
* Missing modules
  This is usually indicated by an error of the form:
      Can't locate MODULE.pm in @INC ....
  Make sure you installed all the required modules (see section 3, above).

* DOS line endings on files
  If you have DOS line endings on files it can break the #! line. Try
  downloading RackMonkey again, or use the dos2unix command.

* Perl version isn't at least 5.61
  If your perl version isn't new enough you will get an error of the form:
      Perl v5.6.1 required--this is only v5.004
  You can download a newer perl from: http://www.perl.com/download.csp 


Missing Graphics and Stylesheet
-------------------------------
If the RackMonkey script runs, but the graphics and stylesheet are missing,
you should check the wwwpath setting in rackmonkey.conf.

Missing Database
----------------
If you get an error of the form:

  DBI connect('dbname=/data/rack.db','',...) failed: unable to open
  database file(1) at dbdimp.c line 94 at /content/rackmonkey.pl line 45 

Check your config to ensure you have the right database path in DBDCONNECT.
    
Unable to Edit/Create Entries
-----------------------------
If RackMonkey is able to display entries without issue, but when you try to
create or edit an entry you get a message similar to the following:

    "...unable to open database file(1)..."
    "...attempt to write a readonly database(1)..." 

You should check the permission on the SQLite database file and the directory
in which it resides. The web servers needs to be able to write to the file and
the directory. This error can only occur when using SQLite, as other databases
engines don't make direct use of files in the same way.

Permission Denied for Relation <table>
--------------------------------------
If you're using Postgres and get an error of the form:

    "...permission denied for relation <table>..."

You haven't granted appropriate permissions to the role (a user in Postgres 
speak) you're using to connect to the database. Try running a command of the
form in psql:

    GRANT ALL ON <table>,<table>_id_seq to <role>;

Where <role> is the role you're using to connect from RackMonkey, and <table>
is the relation mentioned in the error message.
