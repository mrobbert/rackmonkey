User Guide to RackMonkey v1.2
=============================
This document is at a very early stage. Updates will be forthcoming shortly.
You can also get help by selecting the 'Help' tab from within RackMonkey.

First Steps
===========
Get basic information about your set up into the system:
 * Add your own organisation and mark it as a customer so you can assign it to
   devices used internally.
 * If you have a few key customers add them as organisations (you can also add
   them as you add devices).
 * Add one or more domains for your servers, e.g. flux.org.uk
 * Add your locations (buildings, rooms etc.)
 * Add some hardware (though you can do this as you add devices)

Optional Information to add:
 * Add service levels
 * Add extra roles if the included roles aren't suitable
 * Add extra operating systems

You are now ready to add devices
 * You can add them from the devices view
 * You can add from rack layout view: which is more convenient if you're
   adding devices a rack at a time or want to find a free spot for a device.


Restricting Access and Recording Who Made Changes
=================================================
If you protect your rackmonkey.pl script with a .htaccess file RackMonkey will
record the username of the person performing any edits. Otherwise RackMonkey
just records the IP address. Giving each user a separate .htaccess account
will allow you to keep track of who did what when. The last update is shown at
the bottom of single views or a history can be obtained with the logdump 
command (see below).


Reviewing Update Log
====================
Run the logdump command to see a history of changes to the RackMonkey
database. This script can be found in the perl/bin directory of the RackMonkey
distribution. Run logdump with -h to see command line options.
