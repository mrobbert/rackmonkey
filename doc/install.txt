# Install document for RackMonkey v1.2
########################################################################

NB. This document is in the process of being updated for RackMonkey v1.2.

Introduction
============
This doc briefly explains how to install RackMonkey. Please consult the
README before performing an install. See the doc/changes.txt document for
what's new in this release.


Obtaining RackMonkey
====================
Visit http://www.rackmonkey.org to download a packaged release. Packaged
releases are recommended for production use or anyone interested in
RackMonkey as a user.

If you're a developer, or want to try the current head revision, you can
check a release out of Subversion.

The RackMonkey svn server:  https://rackmonkey.svn.sourceforge.net
Path to RackMonkey trunk:   /svnroot/rackmonkey/rackmonkey/trunk

NB. The trunk version contains all the latest developments, but it also
unstable. For production use you should download a packaged version.


Requirements
============
RackMonkey has minimal system requirements, and most unix-based
operating system already have all or nearly all the required software.
It has been tested on the following operating systems:

* FreeBSD 5.3 (i386)
* Solaris 9 (sparc)
* Mac OS X 10.4 (ppc)

* Solaris 10 (x86-64) - In progress
* RHEL 4 (i386) - In progress


Needed to install RackMonkey
----------------------------
* Web server (e.g. Apache - may work under mod_perl, not tested)

* One of the following databases (see README for more):

	- SQLite v3.2.2 or higher
		SQLite3 can be obtained from http://www.sqlite.org
	- PostgreSQL v8 or higher
		Postgres can be obtained from http://www.postgresql.org
	
* Perl 5.61 or higher (5.84 or higher recommended) with the following modules:

	- DBI
	- CGI
	- HTML::Template	
	- DBI driver for your choice of database, either:
		- DBD::SQLite v1.09+ - for SQLite
		- DBD::Pg - for Postgres

The easiest way to install modules is with the CPAN shell. You generally need
to be root in order to do this. 

	perl -eshell -MCPAN
	
On OS X from a terminal you can use sudo to temporarily become root:

	sudo perl -eshell -MCPAN

Then enter your usual admin password when prompted.
	

Once the shell has started (you may be prompted to configure it):

	install DBI
	install CGI
	install HTML::Template

If using SQLite:

	install DBD::SQLite

If using Postgres:
	
	install DBD::Pg


File Installation
=================
Once you have the files from CVS or have uncompressed an archive you
should have a directory with the following content:

doc				Documentation for RackMonkey
README          Read this before you start
perl			Contains the perl scripts and modules
sql             SQL to create the RackMonkey database
t				Directory containing test scripts
tmpl            HTML::Template files for the web interface
www             Web space files, e.g. images, css files

Copy the rackmonkey.pl file and RackMonkey directory from the perl directory
to a suitable location on your web server (e.g. /cgi-bin) and ensure that
rackmonkey.pl is executable by the web server user (chmod 755
rackmonkey.pl is probably what you want). The script assumes the perl
you wish to run it with is /usr/bin/perl, if this isn't the case
open rackmonkey.pl and amend the #! line. 

NB. RackMonkey/Conf.pm will contain the username/password for your
database, this shouldn't reside in normal web space.

Copy the tmpl directory to somewhere that can be read by the web server,
but ideally not in web space.

Copy the contents of the www directory to somewhere within web space
where you want to serve web content from, e.g. /rackmonkey within the
web root. This directory needs to be accessible from a web browser.


Configuring RackMonkey
======================
Take a copy of the default RackMonkey configuration:

cp RackMonkey/Conf.pm-default RackMonkey/Conf.pm 

Open RackMonkey/Conf.pm in your favourite editor. The following values
must be set for your installation (other options can be ignored during
installation).

For SQLite3:
------------
When using SQLite you need to choose a filesystem path for your
database, for example to create your database in
/home/rack/rackmonkey.db, use:
	
use constant DBDCONNECT => 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=/home/rack/rackmonkey.db';

NB. This path must be writable by the web server and should not be
within	web space, or users will be able to download your database. As
we're using SQLite you can leave the DBUSER and DBPASS values blank.

For Postgres:
-------------
If using Postgres you need to create a database for rackmonkey and grant
suitable permissions to a user. For information on how to do this please
see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/. If you've not done much database
administration before, you may find it easier to use SQLite (see above).
	
Postgres databases are created in a location specified by the Postgres
configuration, so you only need to provide a database name, e.g.

use constant DBDCONNECT => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=rackmonkey';

You also need to specify the user and password you created, e.g.
		
use constant DBUSER => 'rackmonkey';
use constant DBPASS => '7jhH#98*';

For All Databases
-----------------
TMPLPATH sets the filesystem path to your template files, something
like:

use constant TMPLPATH => '/home/wgreen/rackmonkey/tmpl';

WWWPATH sets the path within web space that your web content resides,
something like:

use constant WWWPATH => '/rackmonkey';
	

Creating Database Schema
========================

For SQLite3
-----------
Make a note of the path you specified for DBDCONNECT, then simply run:

	sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/schema.sqlite.sql
	
	and
	
	sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/default_data.sql
	
You should then change the permissions of this file and its parent directory
to be readable by your web server. For example, you might change the owner
to 'www' if that is the user your server runs under.

	
For Postgres
------------
Run the following (you may need to specify a username/password):

	psql [DBNAME] < sql/schema.postgres.sql
	
	and
	
	psql [DBNAME] < sql/default_data.sql
	
Where [DBNAME] is the name of the database you created.


Sample Data
-----------
If this is the first time you've installed RackMonkey you should
install the sample data. This contains common companies, roles etc. to
help get you started quickly. To do this run:

	sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/sample_data.sql

	or

	psql [DBNAME] < sql/sample_data.sql

	
Running the App
===============
You can now start the app by pointing your browser at the location of
the rackmonkey.pl script. If you have any issues with running 
RackMonkey see the Troubleshooting section below.

For advice on using RackMonkey see: doc/userguide.txt

When logging a support request please include as much detail as
possible, including database software and revision, and any error
messages.

Internal Server Error
---------------------
If you get an 'Internal Server Error' check your web server error log.
Common causes of this error are:

	* The #! line at the top of rackmonkey.pl doesn't point at perl
		This is the usual cause of errors of the form: 
		[error] (2)No such file or directory: exec of rackmonkey.pl failed
		Try running 'which perl' then setting the #! line at the top of the
		script to match.
	* Permissions incorrect for rackmonkey.pl
		chmod 755 rackmonkey.pl usually solves this
	* ExecCGI isn't turned on for the directory
		Edit your Apache configuration to allow CGIs to be run from this location
	* Missing modules
		This is usually indicated by an error of the form:
		Can't locate MODULE.pm in @INC ....
		If the error is for RackMonkey/Conf.pm ensure you've completed
		configuration, see: 'Configuring RackMonkey' (above).
	* DOS line endings on files
		If you have DOS line endings on files it can break the #! line
		Try extracting the files again, or use dos2unix.
	* Perl version isn't at least 5.61
		Run perl -v to check version number


Missing Graphics and Stylesheet
-------------------------------
If the RackMonkey script runs, but the graphics and stylesheet are missing
you should check the WWWPATH setting in Conf.pm.


Missing Database
----------------
If you get an error of the form:

	DBI connect('dbname=/data/rack.db','',...) failed: unable to open
	database file(1) at dbdimp.c line 94 at /content/rackmonkey.pl line 45 

Check your config to ensure your database path in DBDCONNECT is correct.

	
Unable to Edit/Create Entries
-----------------------------
If RackMonkey is able to display entries without issue, but when you try
to create or edit an entry you get a message similar to the following:

	"...unable to open database file(1)..."
	"...attempt to write a readonly database(1)..." 

You should check the permission on the SQLite database file and the
directory in which it resides. The web servers needs to be able to
write to the file and the directory.

This error can only occur when using SQLite, as other databases engines
don't make direct use of files in the same way.

Permission Denied for Relation <table>
--------------------------------------
If you're using Postgres and get an error of the form:

	"...permission denied for relation <table>..."

You haven't granted appropriate permissions to the role (a user in Postgres
speak) you're using to connect to the database. Try running a command of
the form:

	grant ALL ON <table>,<table>_id_seq to <role>;

Where <role> is the role you're using to connect from RackMonkey, and
<table> is the relation mentioned in the error message.
