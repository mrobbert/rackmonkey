Introduction
------------
Thank you for choosing to try RackMonkey v1.2, I hope you find it useful
in bringing (and keeping) order in your data centres.

Security
--------
You should be aware that RackMonkey has not been fully security-hardened,
so should not be deployed on unprotected public web sites.

Database Support
----------------
RackMonkey supports SQLite or PostgreSQL (Postgres). SQLite is trivial
to configure, but lacks some of the features of Postgres. Your choice of
database will not affect the features available in RackMonkey, so it
really comes down to personal preference. If you're not sure I'd
recommend choosing SQLite as there isn't any configuration to do.

mod_perl
--------
RackMonkey has not undergone any formal testing under mod_perl. Testing
under mod_perl is planned for the near future, until then you should be
careful with running RackMonkey under mod_perl.

Installation
------------
Please read the doc/install.txt file.

Developer Guide
---------------
If you'd like to extend RackMonkey or integrate it into other applications,
please read doc/devguide.txt.

Licence
-------
This software is licensed under the GPL. See doc/licence.txt for details.

------------
