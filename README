1. Introduction
===============
RackMonkey is a web-based tool for managing racks of equipment such as web
servers, video encoders, routers and storage devices. Using a simple interface 
you can keep track of what's where, which OS it runs, when it was purchased, 
who it belongs and what it's used for. No more searching for spreadsheets or 
scribbled notes when you need to find a server: RackMonkey can quickly find 
any device and draw a rack diagram of its location. RackMonkey is free and 
open source (licensed under GPL).

This is a preview release of v1.2.5. For production usage you should use the
latest stable release from: http://www.rackmonkey.org

There isn't yet a documented procedure for moving to v1.2.5 from v1.2.4, the
next preview will include upgrade instructions.
