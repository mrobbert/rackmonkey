WARNING
=======
This is a release candidate for RackMonkey v1.2.4: it is not a finished
release. Please don't use this release on production systems and make sure you
back up any existing RackMonkey databases before using them with this release.

Introduction
------------
Thank you for choosing to try RackMonkey v1.2.4 RC1, I hope you find it 
useful in bringing (and keeping) order in your data centres.

The final release of v1.2.4 is expected during June 2008.

v1.2.4 RC1 Changes from v1.2.3
------------------------------
* Improved interface
* Device search
* Device and Rack copying
* Filtering of Device view
* Experimental MySQL 5 support
* Many other changes and improvements

For a list of changes between Preview 2 and RC1, see doc/changes.txt.

Security
--------
You should be aware that RackMonkey has not been fully security-hardened, so
should not be deployed on unprotected public web sites.

Database Support
----------------
RackMonkey supports SQLite or Postgres (PostgreSQL). SQLite is trivial to
configure, but lacks some of the features of Postgres. Your choice of database
will not affect the features available in RackMonkey, so it really comes down 
to personal preference. If you're not sure I'd recommend choosing SQLite as
there isn't any configuration to do. Experimental support for MySQL is 
included in this release.

mod_perl
--------
A limited amount of testing has been done under mod_perl, but there may still
be issues. Use with caution.

Installation or Upgrading
-------------------------
