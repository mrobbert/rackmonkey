Introduction
------------
Thank you for choosing to try RackMonkey v1.2.4 preview, I hope you find it 
useful in bringing (and keeping) order in your data centres. This is a preview 
release, and as such has undergone limited testing and is subject to change 
before final release. Please don't use this release on production systems and 
make sure you back up your RackMonkey database before using it with this 
release.

Release Highlights
------------------
* Improved interface
* Device search
* Device and Rack copying
* Filtering of Device view
* Experimental MySQL 5 support
* Many other changes, see doc/changes.txt

Security
--------
You should be aware that RackMonkey has not been fully security-hardened, so
should not be deployed on unprotected public web sites.

Database Support
----------------
RackMonkey supports SQLite or PostgreSQL (Postgres). SQLite is trivial to
configure, but lacks some of the features of Postgres. Your choice of database
will not affect the features available in RackMonkey, so it really comes down 
to personal preference. If you're not sure I'd recommend choosing SQLite as
there isn't any configuration to do. Experimental support for MySQL is 
included in this preview release, but has yet to be documented.

mod_perl
--------
A limited amount of testing has been done under mod_perl, but there may still
be issues. Use with caution.

Installation or Upgrading
-------------------------
Please read the doc/install/install.txt file.
