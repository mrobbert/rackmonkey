1. Introduction
===============
RackMonkey is a web-based tool for managing racks of equipment such as web
servers, video encoders, routers and storage devices. Using a simple interface 
you can keep track of what's where, which OS it runs, when it was purchased,
who it belongs and what it's used for.
