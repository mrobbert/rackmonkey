Introduction
------------
Thank you for choosing to try RackMonkey v1.2, I hope you find it useful in
bringing (and keeping) order in your data centres.

Release Highlights
------------------
* Added support for operating system versions.
* Added ability to perform basic filtering of devices in default views.
* Added basic view of unracked devices.
* Added basic reporting.

For more information on what's new in this release see doc/changes.txt.

Known Issues v1.2.2
-------------------
* Row management is disabled.
* App/Device relationship management is disabled.
* Numbering of racks from the top doesn't work. Please leave conf as:
    RACKNUMBERINGTOP => 0;
* When you use 'add' from an edit/create view all your other changes are lost.
* When you use 'add' from an edit/create view only one depth of history is
  remembered (so adding a building from a room from a rack doesn't remember
  the rack view you came from).
* Tick entities don't appear in IE 6 on Windows.
* JavaScript for selecting and deselecting racks in default rack view doesn't 
  work if there is only one item present.
* Untested in IE7 (testing is due to begin shortly).
* Allows rack to be resized even when the resize affects devices.
* Show/hide for device filters is crude and doesn't remember settings.
* Using or resetting filters removes sort order from device default views and
  vice-versa.

Security
--------
You should be aware that RackMonkey has not been fully security-hardened, so
should not be deployed on unprotected public web sites.

Database Support
----------------
RackMonkey supports SQLite or PostgreSQL (Postgres). SQLite is trivial to
configure, but lacks some of the features of Postgres. Your choice of database
will not affect the features available in RackMonkey, so it really comes down 
to personal preference. If you're not sure I'd recommend choosing SQLite as
there isn't any configuration to do.

mod_perl
--------
A limited amount of testing has been done under mod_perl, but there may still
be issues. Use with caution.

Installation or Upgrading
-------------------------
Please read the doc/install.txt file.

User Documentation
------------------
Once installed you should read doc/userguide.txt for advice on getting started
with RackMonkey.
