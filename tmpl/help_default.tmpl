<h3>General Help</h3>
<p>
For full functionality you need a browser with decent CSS support and JavaScript and cookies enabled.
Most buttons and links provide additional information as a tooltip if you hover over them for a few seconds.
For help with server configuration and set up see the INSTALL file. For advice on integrating RackMonkey with
other systems see the DEVGUIDE file.
</p>

<h3>Bugs &amp; Forthcoming Features</h3>
<p>
You can see a list of bugs and forthcoming features on the <a href="http://www.rackmonkey.org/todo">RackMonkey todo</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Before you can create any device entries you need to create at least one building, one room, one row, and one rack
in that order. If you room doesn't have rows of racks, just create one row and place all your racks within it.
You probably also want to create appropriate organisation, role, and hardware (a model of hardware, e.g. Sun T2000) 
entries before adding devices (an individual piece of hardware).
<p>
NB. Organisations have a customer field. If this is checked the organisation shows up in the customer dropdown for
devices. If unchecked the organisation only shows up as a hardware or OS manufacturer.
</p>

<h3>Using the Interface</h3>
<p>
<strong>Hiding/Showing a Column:</strong>
Click on the 'X' next to the name of the column you wish to hide. To show all the columns again, click on 'Show all' next to the name column.
RackMonkey remembers which columns you wish to display, provided you have cookies enabled.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sorting by Column</strong>
You can sort by a given column by clicking on its name in the table header. At present the sort only works by database id for some fields, so items may not be sorted alphabetically.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Adding Items</strong>
There are generally two ways to add an item. Using the [New &lt;item&gt;] link at the top of a view: e.g. you can add a room at the top of the room view.
The second method is to use the [+] buttons within the views themselves: e.g. you can add a room to a specific building by clicking on the [+] at the start
of that building's room list in the building view.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Editing/Creating Forms</strong>
The following buttons appear on edit/create forms:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Create</strong> creates a new entry using the values specified. Some values (e.g. name) must be unqiue, you will receive an error if you use an existing one.</li>
	<li><strong>Save</strong> stores the changes you've made to an existing record.</li>
	<li><strong>Cancel</strong> takes you back to the view of the entry (edit), or back to the list of entries (create).</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong> permanently removes the displayed record from the database; once removed it cannot be restored.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Note on Deleting:</strong>
You can only delete an entry if all its dependancies have also been deleted. For example, if a building contains no rooms you'll see the option [Delete Empty Building] in building view, otherwise this is hidden.
The delete button is always displayed in edit view, but you'll get an error if you use it and the item has dependancies.
